# SI5351_OLED_SHIELD
A simple shield for a two-channel generator with an OLED display.

Encoder change the current bit.
A short press of the encoder button moves the current bit.
A long press toggles the current generator.
When switching, the frequency is recorded in EEPROM and is not reset when turned off.
